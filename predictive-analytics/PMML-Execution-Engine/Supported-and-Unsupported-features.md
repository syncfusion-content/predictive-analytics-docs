# Supported and Unsupported features

Previously PMML Execution engine supported PMML versions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.2.1, that are supported by R [PMML package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmml). Now we have included the functionality to support PMML version 4.3. As of now, only the necessary XML content from input PMML required for scoring supported models has been parsed.
