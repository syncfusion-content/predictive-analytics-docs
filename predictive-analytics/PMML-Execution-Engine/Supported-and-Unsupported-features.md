# Supported and Unsupported features

Previously PMML Execution engine supported PMML version 4.1 that is supported by R [PMML package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmml). Now we have included the functionality to support PMML version 4.2 and 4.2.1. As of now, only the necessary XML content from input PMML required for scoring supported models has been parsed.
