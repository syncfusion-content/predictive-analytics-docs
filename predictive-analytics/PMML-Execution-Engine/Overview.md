# Overview

This section explains you the PMML Execution Engine with its key features, prerequisites to use the API, its compatibilities with Visual Studio Frameworks and finally the documentation details complimentary with the product.

## Introduction to PMML Execution Engine

PMML Execution Engine is a C# library developed for predicting results based on predicted modelling done in PMML over the input data and you can run on the following .NET platforms – Windows Forms.NET, WinRT, WPF, UWP, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET MVC. PMML stands for Predictive Model Markup Language. It is an XML-based file format developed by the [Data Mining Group](http://www.dmg.org) to provide a way for applications to describe and exchange models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms.

## Use Case Scenario

PMML Execution Engine is used to make predictions based on the input PMML file. You can bind the predicted results to dashboard applications for intuitive understanding and decision making. 

## Key Features

Important features of PMML Execution Engine are as follows,

* Predicts the results for corresponding model mentioned in the PMML loaded.
* The results are exactly similar to that obtained from the [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) software.
* Predicts both classification (Categorical values) as well as regression (Numeric values).
* Calculates the probability of prediction in case of categorical values.
* The models currently supported in PMML Execution Engine are,
